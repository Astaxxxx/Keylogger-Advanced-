**Overview**
This Keylogger is a Python-based project developed as part of a Cybersecurity course at Aston University. The purpose of this project is to demonstrate the potential risks and security vulnerabilities posed by malicious software and educate users on the importance of cybersecurity awareness. The code and instructions for running this tool have been intentionally left incomplete to prevent unauthorized use. This project is designed solely for academic purposes and to highlight ethical concerns surrounding cybersecurity threats.

**Features**
Captures all keystrokes on the system (disabled for this project to avoid misuse).
Logs timestamps with each keystroke for monitoring purposes (disabled for this project).
Basic file logging capabilities for analysis.
Note: Email functionality and other potentially harmful features are not included.
Requirements
The project makes use of Python and the following libraries (though some features have been disabled for security reasons):

Python 3.x
Required Libraries:
pynput
os
datetime
platform
You can install the required libraries by running:

bash
Copy code
pip install pynput
Disclaimer: Incomplete Code
Important Note:
As part of ethical considerations and to prevent misuse, I have intentionally left out sections of code and detailed instructions on how to execute this keylogger. This project was developed as part of a Cybersecurity project at Aston University, and is intended for educational purposes only. Any attempt to use, modify, or distribute this project without the proper authorization may lead to legal consequences.

I encourage responsible use of any cybersecurity tools and emphasize the need for explicit permission before monitoring or logging activities on any system.

Logging and Files
The logging and file storage components of the project have been left incomplete to avoid any potential misuse. This tool is designed purely for demonstrating the theoretical concept of keylogging and should not be used in any production or real-world environment.

Legal and Ethical Disclaimer
This tool is for educational purposes only. Unauthorized use of this keylogger to monitor someone’s activities without their explicit consent is illegal and violates privacy laws. The code has been intentionally modified to prevent misuse, and any tampering or unauthorized use of this project could result in legal consequences.

By using or modifying this project, you agree that you are doing so for educational purposes and within the scope of cybersecurity research.
